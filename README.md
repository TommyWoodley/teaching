# Teaching COMP60003: Communicating Computer Science in Schools

This repository is Publically Accessable on GitHub - [GitHub](https://github.com/TommyWoodley/teaching)
Other teachers are welcome to use any resources here with free use and adapt and change however you wish.

This repository contains resources that I have created as part of the COMP6003 Communicating Computer Science in Schools. 
For use in a secondary school. 
The directories contain year group (UK) and corresponding lesson plans and activities.

## Year 13 / A-Level
All resources were created based on the AQA A Level Computer Science.
For Year 13 all lessons were revision/recap style lessons. 
Students had already finished the course, so these lessons are not desinged for First Teaching of the Topic.


## Year 10 / GCSE - Network Security
All resources were created based on the OCR GCSE Computing (J277 first teaching 2020) designed to cover 1.4 Network Security.
The 3 lessons shown are for work with a Year 10 class designed to introduce the concepts.

Lesson Plan for all 3 lessons - [Network Security Lesson Plan](Y10/NetworkSecurity.pdf)

Lesson 1 and Lesson 3 make use of a custom built website [GitHub](https://github.com/TommyWoodley/broken-stbens). For anyone viewing these resources you are more than welcome to fork the repository for your own schools or lessons (I would suggest altering the name and logo of the website - documentation is provided).

Resources for these lessons are organised into folders inside this repository - links are provided below as well. To read I would suggest having the lesson plan pdf open and then opening each resource as you read the lesson plan.
