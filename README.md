# COMP60003: Communicating Computer Science in Schools - Tommy Woodley

This repository is Publically Accessable on GitHub - [GitHub](https://github.com/TommyWoodley/teaching).
Other teachers are welcome to use any resources here with free use and adapt and change however you wish.

This repository contains resources that I have created as part of the COMP6003 Communicating Computer Science in Schools at Imperial College London.
These were all created for use at St. Benedict's School, Ealing, London.
For use in a secondary school. 
The directories contain year group (UK) and corresponding lesson plans and activities.

## Year 10 / GCSE - Network Security
All resources were created based on the OCR GCSE Computing (J277 first teaching 2020) designed to cover 1.4 Network Security.
The 3 lessons shown are for work with a Year 10 class designed to introduce the concepts.

Lesson Plan for all 3 lessons - [Network Security Lesson Plan](Y10/NetworkSecurity.pdf)

Lesson 1 and Lesson 3 make use of a custom-built website [GitHub](https://github.com/TommyWoodley/broken-stbens). 
For anyone viewing these resources you are more than welcome to fork the repository for your own schools or lessons (I would suggest altering the name and logo of the website - documentation is provided).

[St Benedicts Version](https://stormy-oasis-27277.herokuapp.com) - This version is currently hosted via Heroku and is tailed for the School that these lessons were designed for.

Resources for these lessons are organised into folders inside this repository - links are provided below as well. To read I would suggest having the lesson plan pdf open and then opening each resource as you read the lesson plan.

1. Lesson 1: Overview, Types of Malware, Brute Force and DDoS - [Folder](Y10/L1)
   - [Lesson Plan](Y10/NetworkSecurity.pdf) - All lessons for GCSE share the same lesson plans.

## Year 13 / A-Level
All resources were created based on the AQA A Level Computer Science.
For Year 13 all lessons were revision/recap style lessons. 
Students had already finished the course, so these lessons are not desinged for First Teaching of the Topic.
They are more focussed on exam style and ways of approaching questions as well as extending the content further than the A-Level Specification.

1. Assembly

2. Boolean Logic - This lesson requires use of the [A-Level Computer Science Logic and Arithmetic Kit](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/outreach/kits/computer-science-logic-and-arithmetic-kit) from the University of Southampton. It could also be adapted for a virtual version. This lesson was also planned as a 2 hour lesson for both Year 12 and Year 13 during a visit to Imperial College London.
