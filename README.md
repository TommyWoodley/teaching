# Teaching COMP60003: Communicating Computer Science in Schools

This repository contains resources that I have created as part of the COMP6003 Communicating Computer Science in Schools. 
For use in a secondary school. 
The directories contain year group (uk) and corresponding lesson plans and activities.
